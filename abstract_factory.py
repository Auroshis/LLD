"""
Abstract Factory Method is a Creational Design pattern that allows you to produce the families of related objects without specifying
their concrete classes. Using the abstract factory method, we have the easiest ways to produce a similar type of many objects. 
Advantages of using Abstract Factory method:
 - This pattern is particularly useful when the client doesnâ€™t know exactly what type to create. 
 - It is easy to introduce new variants of the products without breaking the existing client code.
 - Products which we are getting from the factory are surely compatible with each other.
Disadvantages of using Abstract Factory method:
 - Our simple code may become complicated due to the existence of a lot of classes.
 - We end up with a huge number of small files i.e, cluttering of files.
Applicability:
 - Most commonly, abstract factory method pattern is found in the sheet metal stamping equipment used in the manufacture of automobiles.
 - It can be used in a system that has to process reports of different categories such as reports related to input, output, and intermediate transactions.
